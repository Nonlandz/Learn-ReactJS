# Deploying Your To-Do List App

This guide will help you deploy your To-Do List application to Vercel, making it accessible to anyone on the internet.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. Your project pushed to a GitHub repository
3. A free Vercel account

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project for Deployment

Make sure your project is ready for production by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized production build of your app.

## Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository

If you haven't already pushed your project to GitHub:

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "todo-list-app")
4. Choose whether to make it public or private
5. Click "Create repository"

Follow GitHub's instructions to push your existing code to the repository:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/todo-list-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign up for an account (you can sign up with your GitHub account)
2. Once logged in, click on "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository by clicking "Import" on your todo-list-app repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a React project
5. Configure your project (usually the default settings work well):
   - Framework Preset: Create React App
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `build` or `dist` (depending on your build tool)
6. Click "Deploy"

Vercel will now build and deploy your application. Once completed, you'll receive a URL where your app is hosted (e.g., `https://todo-list-app-yourusername.vercel.app`).

## Step 4: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use your own domain:

1. Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard
2. Click on "Settings" > "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain and follow the instructions

## Automatic Deployments

One of the benefits of Vercel is automatic deployments. Whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository, Vercel will automatically rebuild and redeploy your application.

## Local Storage Limitations

Note that since this app uses localStorage for data persistence, each user's tasks will be stored in their own browser. This means:

- Tasks are not shared between users
- Tasks are only accessible from the same browser/device used to create them
- Clearing browser data will delete the tasks

If you need multi-device synchronization and persistent storage, consider adding a backend with a database in the future.
